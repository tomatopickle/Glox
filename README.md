# Installation
###### Warning: This skin uses the [backdrop-filter](https://caniuse.com/?search=backdrop-filter) property which is still expermental in Firefox
 ### Requirements: 
  1. Set `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and `layout.css.backdrop-filter.enabled` to true in about:config
   2. Move bookmark items  from the bookmarks toolbar, the toolbar will be removed by the skin (this can be removed later by removing that rule)

 ### Steps
 1. Go to [about:support](about:support), open the profile folder
 2. From that directory, make chrome folder if it doesn't exist
 3. Download the [gloxskin.zip](https://github.com/tomatopickle/Glox/blob/main/gloxskin.zip) file, unzip all it contents to the chrome folder
 4. Restart Firefox

### Note
- You can change the bg.jpg in your chrome folder to any image you prefer
- It's recommended to use Firefox's default dark theme with this skin
